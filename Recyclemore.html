CLOTHING & TEXTILES</h2>
				<p class="para top">

                We all have clothes in our wardrobes or curtains, pillow cases, duvet covers, blankets, sheets and towels in our cupboards that we don’t need or want any more. Sometimes we have items that are past their best too...

                So what can we do with them?
                Charity and re-use organisations

Donate items to charity and re-use organisations, look on the high street for your local shop or fill the bags that come through the door
Clothing and shoe banks are often in supermarket and local car parks – find your nearest one using the recycling locator
If you are fundraising for your school, church, workplace, sports club or organisations such as Girl Guides, or Scouts, there are textile companies who can arrange a textile collection to help you to raise money for your cause. Not only does this generate valuable funds, but creates a great team spirit by getting your supporters to work together to clear out their wardrobes

It’s always worth checking what type of clothing and textiles can be donated, different charity and re-use organisations often collect slightly different items.

Selling

There has never been a better time to sell unwanted clothes and there are lots of ways to do this. With two thirds of people already buying pre-owned and vintage clothes, its an ideal time to try selling yours!

Sell them on websites like eBay, Gumtree and Preloved
In larger towns or cities, look out for a 'cash for clothes' outlet / agency
Or pass on items for free at places such as Freecycle and Freegle
Friends, family and local events

Ask family and friends - often they can use the things we don’t want anymore
Sell items locally at car boots, nearly new and bring and buy sales
Go to local swapping events or start your own at www.swishing.com
Ask local schools if they collect clothes and textiles to raise money
On the high street

Some shops such as H&M and Marks & Spencer collect unwanted clothes in-store. Marks & Spencer also collect via their charity partner, Oxfam and offer a discount off your next purchase
Some antique and vintage shops will buy second hand clothes, such as evening wear and vintage items
Give repairing a go...

If you have items which are ripped, worn or just don’t quite fit anymore, repair or alter them to give them a second life.

Not sure how? Ask family and friends for help, someone is certain to be nifty with a needle and thread
Lots of shops now offer repair and alteration services – look on your high street, search online or look in local directories
Visit Love Your Clothes for great tips on how to make the most of your clothing, including easy to makes repairs
Recycle them...

Clothes and textiles - even old underwear, damaged clothing and faded curtains - that aren’t suitable to be passed onto someone else can be recycled and made into new items, such as padding for chairs and car seats, cleaning cloths and industrial blankets.

Check to see if your council collects clothes and textiles to be recycled
Or use the red 'Where can I recycle?' button above to find your nearest recycling centre
Some charities collect clothing and textiles for recycling, check with your local store or on the bags that come through the door
Clothing and textile banks are often in supermarket and local car parks – check to see if they take items for recycling
