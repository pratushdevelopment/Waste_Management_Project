                Reuse minimization is a process of elimination that involves reducing the amount of waste produced in society and helps eliminate the generation of harmful and persistent wastes, supporting the efforts to promote a more sustainable society.[1] Waste minimisation involves redesigning products and/or changing societal patterns, concerning consumption and production, of waste generation, to prevent the creation of waste.[2]

The most environmentally resourceful, economically efficient, and cost effective way to manage waste is to not have to address the problem in the first place. Waste minimisation should be seen as a primary focus for most waste management strategies. Proper waste management can require a significant amount of time and resources; therefore, it is important to understand the benefits of waste minimisation and how it can be implemented in all sectors of the economy, in an effective, safe and sustainable manner.[2]

The basic concept behind waste management is the waste hierarchy, where the most effective approaches to managing waste are at the top. Waste management is in contrast to waste minimisation. Waste management focuses on processing waste after it is created, concentrating on re-use, recycling, and waste-to-energy conversion rather than eliminating the creation of waste in the initial phases of production.[2] Waste minimisation involves efforts to minimize resource and energy use during manufacture. For the same commercial output, usually the less materials are used, the less waste is produced. Waste minimisation usually requires knowledge of the production process, cradle-to-grave analysis (the tracking of materials from their extraction to their return to earth) and detailed knowledge of the composition of the waste.

The main sources of waste vary from country to country. In the UK, most waste comes from the construction and demolition of buildings, followed by mining and quarrying, industry and commerce.[3] Household waste constitutes a relatively small proportion of all waste. Reasons for the creation of waste sometimes include requirements in the supply chain. For example, a company handling a product may insist that it should be packaged using particular packing because it fits its packaging equipment.

Waste minimisation can protect the environment and provide good economic and business practices. Waste minimisation can improve:[1]

Efficient production practices. Waste minimisation can achieve more output of product per unit of input of raw materials.
Economic returns. More efficient use of products means reduced costs of purchasing new materials improving the financial performance of a company.
Public image. The environmental profile of a company is an important part of its overall reputation and waste minimisation reflects a proactive movement towards environmental protection.
Quality of products produced. New innovation and technological practices can reduce waste generation and improve the quality of the inputs in the production phase.
Environmental responsibility. Minimising or eliminating waste generation makes it easier to meet targets of environmental regulations, policies, and standards. The environmental impact of waste will be reduced.

 <h2 class="style">Top 5 Ways to Reuse Waste Materials</h2>
<p>
 <ul style="list-style:upper-roman">
 <li>Bring reusable bags and containers when shopping, traveling, or packing lunches or leftovers.</li>
 <li>Choose products that are returnable, reusable, or refillable over single-use items.</li>
  <li>Avoid individually wrapped items, snack packs, and single-serve containers. Buy large containers of items or from bulk bins whenever practical</li>
   <li>Be aware of double-packaging - some "bulk packages" are just individually wrapped items packaged yet again and sold as a bulk item.</li>
    <li>Purchase items such as dish soap and laundry detergents in concentrate forms.</li>


 </ul>
